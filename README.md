#Project Bio: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project is an advanced machine learning initiative aimed at accurately estimating the market value of residential properties. Leveraging a variety of data sources, including historical housing prices, economic indicators, property characteristics, and location-based information, this project applies state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to provide precise and reliable predictions.

Objectives
Accurate Price Estimation: Develop models that can predict house prices with high accuracy to aid buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
Market Insights: Analyze the impact of different features on housing prices to offer valuable insights into market trends.
User-Friendly Tools: Create user-friendly applications for stakeholders to easily access and utilize the predictions.
Data Sources
Historical Housing Prices: Data on past sales prices of houses, often sourced from real estate databases and government records.
Property Characteristics: Information on the size, number of rooms, age, and other attributes of the houses.
Location-Based Data: Geographic information, including neighborhood features, proximity to amenities, and crime rates.
Economic Indicators: Relevant economic data such as interest rates, employment rates, and local economic health.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean data from various sources, ensuring it is ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that can significantly impact house prices.
Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train models using historical data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into a production environment where users can input data and receive price predictions.
